  # Introduction
  This repository documents how to use the PyTorch to write a deconvolutional neural network depends on zeiler's method. A convolutional neural network is also implemented to help to test the result. A pretrained VGG16 model and a few pictures was been used for the networks. This repository will be a summary of a learning process of mine which is mainly talk about writing code as well as the theory and package related. I wish to demonstrate an example of writing multiple neural networks to Pytorch users, and a practice of using theory of CNN in real coding.
