  # Introduction
 This project implements zeiler's method to visualize deconvolutional neural network [1]. A convolutional neural network is also implemented to help to test the result. A pretrained VGG16 model and a few pictures was been used for the networks. I wish to demonstrate an example of writing multiple neural networks using Pytorch to vision people, and a practice of using theories of CNN in real coding.
